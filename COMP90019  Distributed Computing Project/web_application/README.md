# Implemented TensorFlow Application on Google Cloud
Based on Google Cloud and TensorFlow Object Detection API and our model to build a web application.
The more detail can be found at https://cloud.google.com/solutions/creating-object-detection-application-tensorflow?hl=en

# Prerequisite
* Google Cloud account

# Useful Commnad on Google Cloud
*  <code>gcloud compute ssh YOUR INSTANCE</code>
*  <code>gcloud compute scp </code> # move files from one directory to another

# Process
1. Following this tutorial https://cloud.google.com/solutions/creating-object-detection-application-tensorflow?hl=en to set up the basic environment.
2. Used this <code>gcloud compute scp </code> to replace our model with the demo model
3. Check the result on the website
4. The result can be found on my lived demo
